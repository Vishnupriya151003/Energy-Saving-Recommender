# Energy-Saving-Recommender
This project is about predicting the energy consumption of the user based on the inputs given and giving the prediction as the result. It predicts the energy consumption of the user and it also compares the energy consumption with the low energy house. It produces two graphs depicting the result of it and gives some energy saving recommendations.
PLEASE NOTE THAT after downloading the files, keep the plot files (energy_comparison_plot.png and energy_plot.png) in the seperate folder named 'static' and all the HTML files (index.html and result.html) in another seperate folder named 'templates'.
The project has been done using the flask library of pythin so it is needed to seperate the required files in this format.
